            <p>Hello World, this has been written in <code>HTML!</code></p>

    being operated only by <em>proffessionals</em> to being used by the average <strong>consumer!</strong></p>

            <p>In the 19th century, it would have been <em>unprecented</em> if a 14 year old was coding on a <strong>personal computer!</strong>
                <br>But here we are.</p>
    
            <p>Don't worry, you're not gonna be here for much longer, I just wanted to shoe you some of my <code>HTML</code>skills.</p>

                            <p><em>Cool right!?</em></p>

                                <br> Be on the lookout for more <code>HTML</code> shenanigans and maybe other cool stuff as I learn to code overtime!</p>
